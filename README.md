Bluetooth Module - Arduino
This repository contains the codebase of a simple Bluetooth module which one can attach to an Arduino Board and control it remotely through a bluetooth controller app. 

The repository is undergoing modifications and soon a source code for a bluetooth control app will be released. <br>
Till then, you can upload the code to the Arduino board and install a Playstore app for sending the signals to the module.

Cheers!!!!
