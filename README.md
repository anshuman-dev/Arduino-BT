Bluetooth Module - Arduino
This repository contains the codebase of simple Bluetooth module which can be attached to an Arduino Board and controlled remotely through a bluetooth controller app. 

The repository is undergoing modifications and soon a source code for a bluetooth control app will be released. 
Till then one can upload the code to the Arduino board and install a Playstore app for sending the signals to the module.

Cheers!!!!
